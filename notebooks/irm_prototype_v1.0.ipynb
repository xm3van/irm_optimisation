    "This prototype aims to identify the optimal parameter for an interest rate model in a LlammaLend market. In this notebook we do not deal with the question of an optimal Utilisation. We use Bertucci et al. (2024) as foundation of this work. The authors formualated IRM parameterisation as stochastic optimal control problem. In practical terms this means, Bertucci et al. used a methodology that can be summarised as: \n",
    "1. **Desiging mathematical model** encapsulating Borrower and supplier behaviour which is reduced to the utilisation ratio.\n",
    "2. **Formulation of an Optimisation Problem** encabsulating the our objective. While utilimately many goals are viable we will focus on the closeness to target utlisation. \n",
    "3. **Attempt an Analytical Solution using HJB**. Use the dynamic programming principle to derive the HJB equation, which characterizes the value function as a partial differential equation (PDE). \n",
    "4. **Solve the HJB equation numerically** Since the HJB equation is often nonlinear and high-dimensional, exact solutions are rare. While mutliple methods exist to arrive at an answer we will be simulate stochastic processes to estimate the value function.\n",

    "##  Desiging the mathematical model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background \n",
    "Developing robust mathematical models is hard - henceforth in my option it is advisable to consult the academic literature. Bertucci et al.,(2024) outlines the following model which while not perfect but is reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The author begin with the assumption that borrower $B_t$ and suppliers $S_t$ do not react to the instanteous rate at given block but to dynamic averages over time. This is their justification to model $B_t$ and $S_t$ as \"solutions to stochastic differential equations, where the dynamics are fundamentally driven by interest rates.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "They introduce two mathematical model, one 2-dimensional model, explicitly modelling $B_t$ and $S_t$ and a 1-dimensional model purely on the utilisation rate. We, as well as the author, will focus on the one-dimensional model, as the utlisation rate $U_t$ is a function of $B_t$ and $S_t$ and for the practical reason that DeFi platforms, as well as the current monetrary polices utiised by [LlammaLend](https://docs.curve.fi/lending/contracts/mp-overview/) primarily rely on the utilization ratio to set the rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Model\n",
    "The utilisation $U_t$ is our state variable, that is it describes the current state of our system. It is given by: \n",
    "$$dU_t = f_U(t, U_t, r_t) \\, dt + \\sigma_U(t, U_t, r_t) \\, dW_t$$\n",
    ", where: \n",
    "- $f_U(t, U_t, r_t) \\, dt$ is the drift term,representing the deterministic part of the model. This term captures how $U_t$ evolves predictably over time due to factors like interest rates and system parameters.It captures how $U_t$ \n",
    "evolves predictably over time due to factors like interest rates and system parameters. It is a function of:\n",
    "    - $t$: The current time.\n",
    "    - $U_t$: The current utilization ratio.\n",
    "    - $r_t$: The current interest rate.\n",
    "- $\\sigma_U(t, U_t, r_t) \\, dW_t$: the diffusion term, representing the random fluctuations in $U_t$. it incorporates: \n",
    "    - $\\sigma_U(t, U_t, r_t)$: The volatility of $U_t$ which depends on time, the current utilization ratio, and the interest rate.\n",
    "    - $dW_t$ A standard Brownian motion term, which introduces randomness into the model, capturing unpredictable changes in $U_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Variables \n",
    "The control variable, that is the decision variable we need to optimise in the objective function is the $r_t$, which is a function of utitisation or our interest rate policy, $r_t = r(t, U_t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective function\n",
    "Given that we assume we can identify $U_{optimal}$ as target, we choose as ojective to minimizing the deviation from a target utilization ratio $U_{target}$ to maximizing $U_t$ at each time $t$ (a.k.a. we choose the Target Utilization Ratio Model Eq. 4). The objective function is given by a stationary variant model, this means we try to optimise over an indefinite time horizon with a discount rate $\\lambda > 0$, unlike a finite horizon model: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\inf_{r \\in \\mathcal{A}^\\infty_U} \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\tau_U} e^{-\\lambda t} \\left( a(U_t - U_{\\text{target}})^2 + \\frac{c}{2} (r_t - \\bar{r})^2 \\right) dt \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{A}^\\infty_U = \\{ (r_t)_{t \\geq 0} : \\text{nonnegative, adapted, and} \\ \\mathbb{E}[\\int_{0}^{\\tau_U} e^{-\\lambda t} r_t^2 dt] < \\infty, \\ \\forall t \\leq \\tau_U, \\ U_t < 1 \\ \\text{a.s.} \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Explanation for dummies**\n",
    "> If you didn't have clue what this mean or why it looks this way, me neither when I first read it. Effectively, it follows a typical Stochastic Optimal Control Cost Function.\n",
    "\n",
    ">What does a typical typical Stochastic Optimal Control Cost Function look like: \n",
    ">1. **Objective:**\n",
    ">   - The cost function aims to minimize an expected cumulative cost over a time horizon, often with a stopping time or constraint ($\\tau_U$ here).\n",
    ">2. **Discount Factor ($e^{-\\lambda t}$):**\n",
    ">   - Common in infinite-horizon problems to prioritize immediate costs over future costs and ensure the total cost remains finite. The discount rate $\\lambda > 0$ reflects the time value of cost.\n",
    ">3. **State Variable Penalty ($a(U_t - U_{\\text{target}})^2$):**\n",
    ">   - Quadratic penalties on the deviation of the state $U_t$ from a desired target $U_{\\text{target}}$ are standard, as they ensure smooth optimization and penalize larger deviations more heavily.\n",
    ">4. **Control Variable Penalty ($\\frac{c}{2} (r_t - \\bar{r})^2$):**\n",
    ">   - A quadratic penalty on the control $r_t$ relative to a reference $\\bar{r}$ is typical to prevent excessive or unrealistic control effort. This term balances the optimization and prevents over-aggressive or erratic behavior in the control variable.\n",
    ">5. **Expectation ($\\mathbb{E}$):**\n",
    ">   - The cost function is stochastic, meaning randomness in $U_t$ and $r_t$ (e.g., due to a Brownian motion or other stochastic drivers) necessitates taking the expectation to account for uncertainty in the outcomes.\n",
    ">6. **Admissible Controls ($r \\in \\mathcal{A}^\\infty_U$):**\n",
    ">   - Constraints on the control $r_t$ ensure feasibility (e.g., $r_t$ must be nonnegative and adapted) and prevent solutions that are unrealistic or overly costly in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Let break it down a Equation itself to understand what it does: \n",
    "> 1. **Objective**:\n",
    ">   - Minimize the total cost combining:\n",
    ">     - $a(U_t - U_{\\text{target}})^2$: Penalizes deviations of the utilization $U_t$ from the target $U_{\\text{target}}$.\n",
    ">     - $\\frac{c}{2}(r_t - \\bar{r})^2$: Penalizes deviations of the control $r_t$ from the reference rate $\\bar{r}$.\n",
    "> 2. **Stationary Variant**:\n",
    ">   - Includes a discount factor $e^{-\\lambda t}$, prioritizing immediate costs over long-term costs.\n",
    "> 3. **Constraints**:\n",
    ">   - $ r_t$: Must be nonnegative and adapted (depends only on available information).\n",
    ">   - $U_t < 1$: Utilization must remain below 1 (e.g., avoiding overutilization).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**\n",
    "You may wonder, why is the cost function cost $(r_t - \\bar{r})^2$. Bertucci et al., acknowledge their arbitrary choice of a quadratic cost functional $(r_t - \\bar{r})^2_+$, emphasizing that different powers $q$ would significantly alter the behavior of the optimal control, with $q = 2$ chosen for clarity and its critical role in balancing practicality and theoretical implications.\n",
